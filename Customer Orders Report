#In this project, I worked on a database filled with customer order information going back multiple months to answer the following questions


#1. How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT count(orderID) AS order_count FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE orderID<>"Order ID" AND length(orderID)=6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT count(*) AS order_count FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE orderID<>"Order ID" AND length(orderID)=6
AND Product="iPhone";

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT BIT_DB.customers.acctnum FROM BIT_DB.customers
Inner JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id=BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT Product, price, sum(quantity) AS total_sold 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Group By Product ORDER BY price Asc; 

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, price, sum(Quantity) AS total_sold, ROUND(sum(Quantity)*price,2) AS Revenue 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales Group By Product; 

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity), price, sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue, location 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE location="548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 
SELECT acctnum, sum(Quantity) AS total_bought, Round(sum(price*Quantity), 2) AS amount_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales 
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.customers ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id=BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE Quantity>2 AND Quantity<>"Quantity Ordered" AND acctnum IS NOT NULL
Group By acctnum;


-- List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold --
SELECT Product, Sum(Quantity) AS total_sold 
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Where location like "%Los Angeles%"
Group by Product;

--Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).
SELECT location, count(orderID) AS total_orders
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales WHERE location LIKE "%NY%"
AND length(orderid)=6 AND orderid<>'Order ID'
GROUP BY location HAVING count(orderID)>=3;

--How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity) AS total_sold, price, sum(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales WHERE Product LIKE "%Headphones%"
Group By Product;

--What was the average amount spent per account in February?
SELECT sum(Quantity*price)/count(acctnum) as avg_spent
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers ON BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID=BIT_DB.customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid)=6 AND orderid<>'Order ID';

--What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT count(acctnum), sum(Quantity)/count(acctnum) as avg_purchased
FROM BIT_DB.customers RIGHT JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales ON BIT_DB.customers.order_id=BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID;

--Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT Product, sum(quantity) AS total_sold, price, Round(sum(quantity)*price) AS product_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product ORDER BY product_revenue desc LIMIT 1;
